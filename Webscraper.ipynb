The problems are mainly related to 2 things: the culture, and the managers/higher ups. The culture is terrible, no work-life balance, repetitive tasks and slow progression, it's a traditional company, and you benefit from setting down roots, taking a long time (think 3 to 5 years) to reap the benefits of your hard work and drive. Now, the biggest problem for me was the managers. They're completely against remote work, planning to go completely on-site again, even if it costs several of the best workers in the field, just because of the \"image\" it presents. Irrelevant meetings that take most of your time, and destroy productivity, zero flexibility for personal problems or just normal delays, things like that are to be expected.

They tend to keep the competent employees from moving forward in their career simply because they don't want to lose the employee to another line of business, branch or department. Some management is decent, but there is no accountability or follow through. \n",

Managers are however almost always understanding with time off as it's a take it or lose it company.  My biggest complaint however with Chase is the lack of advancement opportunities as well as ghosting internal applications for those not in the hubs such as New York or Ohio.  This is very frustrating as they praise themselves on internal mobility but good luck going from Retail to back office which they well never even give you a call.\n",

The pay is great, management is awesome and always willing to help, time off is good too, mental health (which is very important to me) is supported through the employee assistance program & if you want to go back to school, there are programs that are 100% paid for by Chase.  Everything about it is amazing.  I don't see any reason to ever leave.  \n",

Most real opportunities are lateral, not really career advancing.

Make it as temporary as you possibly can, even the first-line management (Team Leads) were pretty miserable with the company policies and day-to-day and this was the only \"advancement\" position I saw achieved with any regularity.\n",

My assigned branch was a small 5-person branch and it was cold and uninviting. Everyone else already had known and worked with each other for years before I joined so I always felt like the odd one out. However, when I got to assist other branches I had some of the best teams with some of the best workplace culture, but transferring branches will be near impossible if your manager doesn't like you like mine did. Your experience will heavily depend on branch you get assigned to and how receptive your team is of you personally. HR is always an option but they're in the business of protecting the corporation and its managers, you'd be wasting your time.\n",

But with the attrition that occurred prior to, and then much more during, the Pandemic, pay is very good now. Especially if you can reach management. Health insurance is alright, time off  is great, 401k matching is great, pension was great for everyone prior to 2018. No longer offered. Job itself is good if your manager is good. You need to be strong in your role to succeed. If you are not, you will have a hard time. Major cons are that you will get overworked and OT is not an option. Bonuses are dismal and your income is heavily weighed against the economy. You will get a quarterly email on how the bank made so much money, but in the end they will say not enough and there will be no COLA increases. However overall, if you can make it through the work week, the pros will out weigh the cons. \n",

The branch you’re at will really determine whether the job is a good one or not.

There’s no room for advancement either, as there is not a high turnover rate in any lead/higher positions\n",

My manager would send me coaching a and rarely meet with me to discuss them. Sometimes I wouldn’t have any feedback or contact with my manager for months. Once they decided to get rid of me they decided to dig through all my calls and find anything to fire me for. You will only move up within the call center if you are managements favorite. \n",

They do not reward competence and hard work, only blindly loyal tattle-tales even if they don't do their job. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Sell sell sell! Never stop selling. It isn't a sales role, though. But remember to keep pushing products on clients. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Be told you aren't making enough phone calls as soon as the branch open, handle 15 walk- in appointments, and then still be told you aren't doing enough, pile more on your own plate to your own detriment, and then get fired.\n",

You are paid very well, above average, and are expected to output accordingly. The problems are mainly related to 2 things: the culture, and the managers/higher ups. The culture is terrible, no work-life balance, repetitive tasks and slow progression, it's a traditional company, and you benefit from setting down roots, taking a long time (think 3 to 5 years) to reap the benefits of your hard work and drive. Now, the biggest problem for me was the managers. They're completely against remote work, planning to go completely on-site again, even if it costs several of the best workers in the field, just because of the \"image\" it presents. Irrelevant meetings that take most of your time, and destroy productivity, zero flexibility for personal problems or just normal delays, things like that are to be expected. Of course, not everyone is like this, but from my experience, there's only a couple of good apples left.\n",

But please make sure that your health insurance is worth more than your mental health. All managers are horrible and leave all the work for the LAOs. The Market Director plays favoritism so you have little chance to move up. If you’re an LAO the only route you have for “growth” is Branch Manager which your only chance of getting promoted is to leave the company and come back.

Training is a big thing for new joiners (several development programs across the bank), support for experienced highers is somewhat subpar, so you'll need to be a self-starter to really succeed. It is strictly hierarchical with a very outdated advancement structure past VP basically requiring managerial ability vs individual contributors. \n",

Unfortunately my branch has a strict, micro managing culture. In other words, walking on broken glass and being told what you’re doing wrong and less appreciation. Work/life balance?… forget about it! You’ll get in trouble for any reason you have to step out during the day or even a planned day off. \n",

There so much you need to know and there is not enough training to take it all in. They have a Google search engine for like the company and that wasn't always helpful or have to read a whole article to find the answer even though we had to be fast on the call and couldn't put then on hold for long. Also got dinged for transferring calls even if you had to because they didn't a different department.\n",

The consistent theme will be food and focus on process improvement.Management needs improvement since the departments are very siloed. Each line of business competes with others to retain the best talent for budget concerns. Most people with tenure are allowed to post and interview within their own department but approval is required for you to interview outside the department.  The Executive Directors can prevent you for accepting a position outside their organization.These challenges and the constant and often those being considered for a role go without resolution or feedback because leaders with more direct reports of record or former executives leave the company and return to receive reinstatement to their former roles.It's ok to be competitive but the playing field needs to be level.\n",

The claims queue is not as busy but once you get upskilled to fraud you will get slammed with back to back calls all day from clocking in to clocking out. Its hard to not get burned out easily when you have upset yelling customers all day. Working in a call center environment is for someone with thick skin because some customers will use profanity unfortunately. Aside from that, the pay is to get by every month if you budget accordingly, supervisors dont really check on you so its very independent, you work from home if you have good performance and are tenured at least 2 years, you also get plenty of sick/vac/personal hrs and some roll over to the new year if you dont use them all. If you can handle the busy environment then youll like it here. But ultimately, the goal for everyone is to get off the phones and apply to another department.\n",

Strong support of diversity, career development and advancement, work/life balance, and support for emergency leave. What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Training was tough. Sometimes you feel isolated with little knowledge of who to return to. Additionally, my branch manager was hard to work with because they were never around and unsupportive.

Be sure to interview your potential manager and understand that HR is designed to protect the company, not you. There are good managers, and there are narcissistic bosses. I experienced mostly great coworkers and work life balance, fair pay for work, and great client relationships. However, the one really bad experience ruined my opinion, my physical and mental health and career. The acceptance of  favoritism, clicks, and pitting employees against eachother was insane. I'm not the only one with this experience. Overall, good company with some bad seeds going in a questionable direction for employees and clients. \n",

You will have customers who are 100% okay with you but because the banks policy screwed them they will give you a bad survey and even though you were polite, correct and helped with the situation you will be blamed for the bad survey even though chase is the one who dumped on them.

The company continually takes monetary incentives away and tries to replace them with a good old pat on the back and a company wide thank you email. The turnover rate is very high. You’re constantly having to pick up the slack for other coworkers and other branches and never even acknowledged for doing so. The management just looks to you to again pick up more slack.\n",

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?Leadership sets goals to maximize shareholder value, but frontline employees are undervalued and micromanaged with difficult expectations. What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Overall, it’s a good culture. But the particular branch I worked at had a particularly bad culture and that was a direct result of its branch managers choices.  He was a micromanager, and it was clear he views his employees as ways for him to make more money than as human beings. It lacked extraordinary value in diversity and inclusion. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Get told why you’re not doing things correctly at work. Consistently feel excluded by leadership. Cry in the back hoping no one notices. Discuss opportunities with a client, make the company more money without getting recognized for your hard work. Do several cold calls a day.\n",

Hard to change your scheduleWhat is the most stressful part about working at the company?Fast pace environment. Ranking is hard, their requirements are way to high.What is the work environment and culture like at the company?Stuck up management. Depends on who your supervisor is, if she doesn't like you then you will never move up from your current position. Every time you apply for another position it's up to your supervisor discretion. So kiss your supervisor you know what, otherwise you will be on a death end job. I worked many years there and my Spanish supervisor didn't like me, she didn't let me move up. Therefore I left. What is a typical day like for you at the company?Extremely stressful! everyday is a huge load of work...something 8 hours a day. Nothing ever changed.\n",
